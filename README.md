# Description
This study proposes a hybridized algorithm termed Archimedes optimization algorithm-based least square (AOA-LS)
technique for estimation of harmonics of a power system. The proposed optimization algorithm contributes to predicting the
phases of the harmonic signal, and the conventional least-square (LS) method determines the amplitudes. The simulation was conducted for a voltage wave obtained from a standard testing module's load bus terminal under two noisy conditions ( Uniform and Gaussian noise).


# Code Use

Use the "Hybrid LS" code to run the simulation. (This case contains the case study for 20 dB Gaussian noise)
